Note: the virtual environment is created in the directory in which you run the command 

export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=23a9fab99eee4d3a81a64dcbbe35b546
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=b2eb7cde914b4aaaaec6f4b542378dfa
export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000

Note: the export commands set environment variables local to the shell in which you run them.
If this shell is closed or restarted, the export commands need to be used again to once again set the environment variables.

to run app: streamlit run <app name>.py
